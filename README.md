# Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-for-Google-Stock-Prices
This project performs a time series analysis of Google stock prices, aiming to forecast future price movements using techniques from the forecasting and time series analysis domains. The R libraries forecast, quantmod, and tseries are used to gather, manipulate, and analyze stock data.

Key Steps:
Data Collection:

The dataset for Google stock prices is retrieved using the getSymbols() function from the Yahoo! Finance platform, focusing on data from February 1, 2021, onwards. Various price attributes, including opening, high, low, closing, volume, and adjusted prices, are extracted and visualized using line plots.
Target Variable:

The closing price of Google stock is identified as the target variable for prediction. This variable, GOOGL.Close, is visualized to understand its overall trend.
Stationarity Check:

The stationarity of the time series (mean and variance) is checked, as it is crucial for building accurate forecasting models. The series is found to be non-stationary. To address this, differencing is applied:
Differencing the mean removes trends, resulting in a stationary mean.
Log differencing stabilizes the variance.
Both transformations are visualized to confirm stationarity.
ACF and PACF Analysis:

The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) are employed to identify the order of the AR (AutoRegressive) and MA (Moving Average) components for model building.
Forecasting Models:

The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model is typically used after analyzing ACF and PACF plots to capture the underlying patterns and make future predictions, although the exact model-fitting details aren't fully visible in the snippet.


Conclusion:
This project showcases how time series analysis techniques can be applied to real-world stock market data. By checking for stationarity, applying appropriate transformations, and using ACF/PACF plots to identify model parameters, it demonstrates the process of forecasting future stock prices, which is a critical task in financial markets.
